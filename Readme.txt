Welcome to the Readme File!

In this file you'll find the instructions needed in order to know
how to evaluate this technical test.

First, you'll be able to see the folder "DB-Test" with three files in it:
"Report 1.sql", "Report 2.sql" and "Report 3.sql".
These correspond to the DB Test.

After that, you'll see the folder "BackEnd-Test". Within this folder is all
the source code generated for the backend test.

In order to make it work, you'll have to do the following:

- In a command line, go to the folder directory.
- Once there, start the server by typing "node server.js". This will start
the server in localhost at port 3000.
- Now, you can go to localhost:3000/ in your browser, in order to open the
test's home page.
- From there, you can navigate, and use the functionalities developed.

Thanks for your attention!

Greetings,

Ricardo Andrés Cardona Alarcón :)
